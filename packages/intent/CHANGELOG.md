# @tanstack/intent

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#258](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/258) [`920a3d5`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/920a3d5c9871304379ddbe61b00ef417257a097c) - Bring library skill authoring and maintenance into the normal coding-agent workflow. `intent install --maintainer` installs persistent guidance for agreed skill batches, source-grounded updates, representative executable task checks, and fresh-consumer verification when available.

  Add `intent review` to identify affected guidance and unmapped changes from Git, then record evidence-backed outcomes against source and skill content hashes. A skill or planning record with no recorded review is compared with the commit that introduced it. Repeated no-ops stay quiet until content changes; missing source evidence remains unresolved. The generated release workflow uses recorded reviews when present and retains the existing staleness fallback otherwise.

  Require every authoring batch to create and incrementally maintain `domain_map.yaml`, `skill_spec.md`, and `skill_tree.yaml`, preserving prior coverage, maintainer decisions, and remaining work. Track their review against source and skill contents and keep missing or invalid records unresolved. Keep focused authoring available through `maintainer setup`, `maintainer add`, `meta generate-skill`, and review reminders without mandatory full-library discovery. Add maintainer fixtures and protected task graders.

  Separate activation guidance in `description` from descriptive text in `metadata.purpose`, preserving original descriptions when migrating existing skills. Expose purpose separately in discovery and `list --json`; older skills remain supported. Group related features by developer task, use references for conditional detail, check discovery separately from task correctness, and bundle tested scripts only when useful.

  Keep the review-state lock held through atomic replacement, explain stale locks, and render repository-controlled review fields as untrusted data. Use the same command runner for reminder follow-up review commands.

  Replace `scaffold` with `intent maintainer setup|add|status|sync|review|check`. Initialize cumulative records and copy the `check-skills.yml` CI workflow when none exists, register package-owned skills, synchronize frontmatter and publishing metadata, and check authoring gaps and revision-bound reviews through deterministic commands. Preserve existing authored decisions and custom record locations.

- [#262](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/262) [`e560b60`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/e560b60e59f5063606252513ceed687f7767e988) - `maintainer setup` replaces `maintainer adopt`, which is removed along with its JSON plan and `--apply`; update any script that called it. Setup registers existing package-owned skills found under `skills/` directories that the skill tree does not record yet. Skill contents are preserved; the domain comes from `metadata.domain`, the domain map, or the parent directory, and defaults to `uncategorized` for the maintainer to edit. Invalid or conflicting skills are reported and left unregistered. Agent skill directories, dependencies, and packages outside the workspace are not scanned.

- [#263](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/263) [`d4eca84`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/d4eca844556b34ed0f281f9f9c11052233ce949f) - Add optional interactive maintainer review with guidance and source-diff inspection, per-item reasons and evidence, and confirmation before recording. Reuse existing fingerprints and evidence validation, retain JSON workflows, and prohibit interactive prompts in CI. Add `maintainer review --unchanged <reason>` and `--updated <reason>` to record one outcome for every pending item in a single command, with the reviewed revision and changed files as evidence.

- [#260](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/260) [`3437a6c`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/3437a6c8a6d8d0365f41cd0834c6b17195158931) - Add explicit repository skill distribution to the maintainer command workflow. Package-only distribution is the default and needs no record. Keep skills in their owning packages, record a selection or an explicit opt-out in `skill_tree.yaml`, and generate Claude/Cursor plugin metadata and consumer install commands for `npx skills add` and `gh skill add`. Preserve unrelated plugin fields, require explicit prerequisite selection, and check generated files for drift without publishing or installing anything on the maintainer's behalf.

  Find selected package skills even when root-level skills exist, and reject conflicting Claude marketplace-only definitions before writing generated files.

- [#289](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/289) [`0a42b40`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/0a42b40fe264442e8e91bccb19099ed2dc34979d) - `validate` checks every fenced TypeScript and JavaScript block in a `SKILL.md` against the owning package's own types when TypeScript is available in the repository. A renamed export, a removed option, or a changed shape fails validation with the skill file and line. Imports of exports marked `@deprecated` produce warnings, and relative Markdown links must resolve. Names, modules, and globals a partial snippet leaves out are not reported. Repositories without TypeScript skip the code checks with a notice. Pending review items for skills report whether their examples still compile.

### Patch Changes

- [#279](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/279) [`c642ba8`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/c642ba8f2a27af08624c1fb17727018dcd1254d6) - Ship `@tanstack/intent` with zero runtime dependencies. The libraries it uses (`yaml`, `semver`, `jsonc-parser`, `cac`, `std-env`, `@clack/prompts`) are now bundled and tree-shaken into `dist`, which cuts the install footprint from roughly 2.4 MB across 10 packages to under 1 MB in one, and makes every command start faster because Node loads a few chunks instead of ~150 files from `node_modules`.

- [#276](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/276) [`74d1b26`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/74d1b264c931880e2bfe13c518b1944e50a233d9) - Speed up dependency discovery. Resolve each dependency directory with a plain `node_modules` walk plus a single symlink collapse instead of Node's module resolver, which evaluated export maps and realpathed every path segment per lookup, and resolve each package's real root once per package instead of once per skill. `intent list` in a pnpm monorepo runs roughly 30% faster; discovered packages and paths are unchanged.

- [#282](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/282) [`fc5472a`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/fc5472a516a18c0068334e23326adb33c7038780) - Cut the filesystem work in dependency discovery. Each dependency edge now costs one `readlink` instead of a stat through the symlink plus an `lstat` and a `realpath`; symlink targets, candidate paths, and `node_modules` directories are memoized per scan; and directories the walk has already resolved skip their identity `lstat`. Workspace pattern sorting no longer initializes the ICU collator on every run. `intent list` in a pnpm monorepo runs about 35% faster and in an npm project about 25% faster, with identical results.

- [#283](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/283) [`0be3bc7`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/0be3bc7504376f64689b7f19e8345e10d4018188) - Make agent hooks fast when `@tanstack/intent` is installed in the project. The session-start catalog previously ran `npx @tanstack/intent@latest list` (or the pnpm, yarn, or bun equivalent), which resolves the package against the npm registry on every session start and took one to four seconds; the runner now executes the locally installed CLI directly with the current Node binary, which takes about a tenth of a second, and falls back to the package-manager runner only when there is no local install. When that installation also has a `node_modules/.bin/intent` shim, the catalog suggests `node_modules/.bin/intent load <package>#<skill>` for loads (otherwise it keeps suggesting the package-manager runner), and the edit gate recognizes that form. Reinstall hooks with `intent hooks install` to pick up the new runner.

- [#278](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/278) [`0c074e3`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/0c074e3da6f2241475ae209b51ac1195ecafa716) - Trim `intent list` and `intent load` startup. Discovery no longer loads the `semver` package on every run (a small built-in comparator picks between duplicate installed versions of a package, with identical results), and `intent install` loads its interactive prompt library only when it actually prompts.

- [#273](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/273) [`36a1bf1`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/36a1bf1cd2a9fdab842f215ec1a8df7b04eee4a8) - Record developer tasks at registration with `maintainer add --task`, retire a registered skill with `maintainer remove <name>` without deleting its guidance, and include the recording contract (allowed outcomes and required fields) in `review --json` reports. Evidence may be a single string or a list, and the report points at `.intent/review.json`, which review ignores.

- [#272](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/272) [`33b5e8b`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/33b5e8b0a38877a121ef4f2b38c39c236b6ca383) - Print an ordered overview for `intent maintainer --help` and per-action options for `intent maintainer <action> --help`. Name every file `maintainer add` and `maintainer sync` write, label consumer install commands, show changed files and missing reviews in `maintainer status` and `check`, validate each skills root once, report all missing repository-distribution inputs together, and print unsupported options in their kebab-case form.

- [#271](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/271) [`337f8f5`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/337f8f537ac63c89e9c557d19911fcbc2c739997) - Stop reporting files Intent writes as unmapped source changes. Agent instruction files, generated plugin metadata, the CI workflow, package manifests, and lockfiles no longer need a recorded review unless a skill maps them; `review.ignore` in `skill_tree.yaml` adds repository-specific patterns.

  Register a skill with the workspace package that owns the current directory when `maintainer add` runs without `--package`. Reject a review record that annotates no outcomes and explain the required fields. Accept per-skill `files` entries written by `maintainer sync` during validation. Advise the current CI workflow version.

- [#291](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/291) [`909f5fc`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/909f5fcb98c0c90489d939823e36bf0f562fd040) - Generate commands for installed Intent, reject unsafe setup write paths before creating records, and validate distribution selections before writes. Check JavaScript library contracts and JSX examples across supported Markdown fences, and reuse validation results in maintainer reports to avoid compiling the same examples twice.

- [#292](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/292) [`305ca7f`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/305ca7fbf6f199bc794dd2fe8a04d7f83d3fa62e) - Add a lightweight `intent repair` command for unambiguous frontmatter migrations and reviewable before/after example patches. Preserve conflicting metadata and refuse alias edits that could change unrelated fields. Write mode applies only safe frontmatter changes; code-example suggestions require review and are emitted as patches without changing source files.

- [#284](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/284) [`864562c`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/864562c4035c3382887973ac9e53decb1b436d08) - Keep Markdown link destinations that contain a private-use character (U+E000) intact when `intent load` and `intent meta` rewrite relative paths; the escape placeholder is now chosen so it never collides with the destination's own characters.

- [#267](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/267) [`54f7d97`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/54f7d97292afc22c9ce99995bd56c8103aa7c0f4) - Refresh workspace roots, patterns, and members between core operations. Keep workspace discovery reuse within the existing operation-local filesystem cache so listing and loading observe changed membership and source kinds.

  Avoid enumerating unrelated workspace members and reading unused skill metadata during direct loads. Preserve fresh policy reads and final path checks.

- [#290](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/290) [`ed6ca00`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/ed6ca00e031c249d0468d62248a387cd2a1543ca) - Run skill checks through reusable GitHub workflows pinned to the immutable commit packaged with the installed Intent release. Setup validates generated workflow inputs and write paths before copying files. Analysis uses the repository's locked CLI, disables dependency lifecycle scripts, and has read permissions. Optional review publication runs separately with bounded report validation.

  The PR workflow runs one combined validation check and can prepare mechanical repairs and suggested example patches for review. It retains the patches when validation fails and never publishes fixes or marks semantic reviews complete. `intent maintainer check --github-summary` reports authoring issues, stale generated files, and pending source reviews in the GitHub Actions step summary.

  Validation counts each skill once across overlapping custom roots and avoids duplicate packaging warnings for the same skill.

- [#268](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/268) [`fab9591`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/fab95914ab34bcdd3766c8d19991e86dae5c585b) - Generate standalone hook command parsing from the tested policy parser. Preserve agent-specific output, install ownership, and fail-open catalog behavior.

- [#265](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/265) [`5f56f22`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/5f56f22c035b8dd425e140ab51c6b41cb4e36a9a) - Reuse parsed planning records, source hashes, and Git source matches within maintainer operations. Keep fresh checks for later reports and writes.

- [#275](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/275) [`9e73959`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/9e7395929195f44c03b18caaffe0bb33966a389e) - Fix Windows path handling. Preserve backslash escapes in Markdown link destinations when `intent load` and `intent meta` rewrite relative paths (an escaped `\)` was normalized into a path separator). Normalize the Git repository root reported by `git rev-parse` so `intent maintainer add` no longer rejects every skill path with "must belong to the selected package", and print repository-relative paths in maintainer output and `maintainer status --json` with forward slashes on every platform.

- [#266](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/266) [`7a2a9e1`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/7a2a9e1fbc5baa43cb092a3dcf88e1e5a4cb5722) - Recognize Intent installed as a devDependency at the owning workspace root when validating package skills.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#224](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/224) [`78b77b1`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/78b77b1e8b985cc14bdbf8b25a3481eff86394c7) - Add exact npm and workspace skill selectors to `intent.skills`.

- [#241](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/241) [`b0f9726`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/b0f9726cd533b7b5256aec9d4512b4fb16ca8cda) - Add interactive first-run skill permission setup to `intent install`. Enable all sources, choose packages or scopes, or select individual skills in compact searchable lists. Save package and scope rules without expanding them into individual names. Optional skill review shows only selected packages and opens individual skill lists only for packages chosen for review. Keep all other selections and exclusions, with one confirmation before saving. Inspect descriptions and existing exclusions on demand; excluded skills cannot be enabled, empty discovery leaves setup available for retry, and completion reports available skills and the next command.

- [#255](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/255) [`0b67487`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/0b674874944b19d2499a4ae3f9d6dbcf879577af) - Add `intent install --review` to revisit existing skill permissions, inspect current access, and confirm additions, removals, and individual exclusions. Preserve undiscovered rules and inherited permissions unless explicitly changed. Keep default configured installs guidance-only, reuse one discovery scan throughout review, and compile permission rules once per selection pass.

### Patch Changes

- [#257](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/257) [`25f64ad`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/25f64adc380c1c995c2856e7742976d996c960bf) - Reduce repeated filesystem reads and path calculations in list, load, validate, and stale commands. Reuse command-scoped manifests, skill discovery, and shared workspace artifacts; index artifact matches once per package and batch workspace identity checks.

- [#242](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/242) [`4e59119`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/4e5911932396e74404a6a57b84fddd823ccea3d4) - Stop policy-controlled skill listing and loading when a project policy manifest is unreadable, malformed, or not a JSON object. Report the manifest path instead of treating failed reads as missing policy and exposing skills. Preserve migration behavior for genuinely missing manifests.

- [#244](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/244) [`b069294`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/b06929407f2f458b6db98b6d2271a47f58daca5b) - Reject unsafe dynamic identifiers before normalization in runnable list commands, install mappings, and runtime lookup hints. Skip skill metadata that resolves outside its package root, verify the opened file's identity before reading, and keep large-frontmatter reads on the same descriptor. Preserve valid package-manager symlinks and direct-load containment errors.

- [#256](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/256) [`223be7d`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/223be7df7b2c281106469faf86a35d1732264b8d) - Make the shipped meta-skills pass Intent validation. Match names to their existing directories, use string metadata, and move detailed procedures and templates into packaged references without changing the meta command names. Resolve relative Markdown links in `intent meta <name>` output so reference paths work from the caller's directory.

- [#256](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/256) [`223be7d`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/223be7df7b2c281106469faf86a35d1732264b8d) - Reject unreadable and malformed ancestor package manifests while discovering workspace policy, so a nested application's allowlist cannot bypass inherited restrictions when the workspace root is unreadable. Stop ancestor discovery at the first workspace declaration or Git repository boundary, checking that directory's manifest before stopping. Without an independent boundary, malformed ancestors fail closed and identify the file to repair.

## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- [#217](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/217) [`481cfbb`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/481cfbb9be7268cf06103c2ede34b188df63cfd9) - Include package-manager-specific load commands in SessionStart skill catalogs and clarify that Intent skills are not native agent skills.

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes

- [#214](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/214) [`5af1c80`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/5af1c809b8ec281cd15a9a0427380b81f2e8fa5a) - Allow agent hooks to continue after checking Intent guidance when no matching skill applies.

- [#210](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/210) [`bb18ee0`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/bb18ee0ad58b8706827f062b2e23d66f26496af0) - Remove internal milestone wording from unsupported `git:` source errors.

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- [#201](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/201) [`ca0c761`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/ca0c7613f0fb2071db6c9efad2079aeecc95b13b) - Support `*` package patterns such as `@tanstack/*` in `intent.skills` allowlists.

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- [#194](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/194) [`e885566`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/e8855664ff7eeb37a8ee4fed3c01a0dbded14dc6) - Fix `setup`, `setup-github-actions`, `meta`, and `scaffold` failing with "No templates directory found" / "Meta-skills directory not found" in the published package. `getMetaDir` hardcoded `../../meta`, which is correct for the `src/commands/` source layout but overshoots to `@tanstack/meta` from the flat `dist/` layout the build ships. Walk up to the first `meta/` directory instead so resolution works in both layouts (and symlinked installs).

- [#191](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/191) [`3620cca`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/3620ccad89eeca310b6f72e64cbea0280eef37f3) - Tighten skill-source identity to `(kind, id)` instead of name alone: `workspace:foo` no longer authorizes an npm-installed `foo` (and vice versa) in `intent.skills`, the "declared but not discovered" notice, and skill loading via `intent load`.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [#190](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/190) [`45c863d`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/45c863d2389d203862b7b2f9f9f81316fab5207d) - Improve the maintainer skill-authoring workflow:

      - Add `validate --set-version <version>`, which stamps `metadata.library_version` across matched skills via YAML surgery (preserving comments, line endings, and body) and then re-validates.
      - Correct the `generate-skill` meta-skill so it no longer emits slash-path `name` values that fail validation, and the `skill-staleness-check` meta-skill so it points at the real `intent stale` command instead of a non-existent script.

- [#188](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/188) [`2a25b36`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/2a25b360843801848a01af7b21b39646e6a5a53b) - Refuse to load a Yarn PnP runtime resolved from within node_modules; only a project root or ancestor .pnp.cjs is trusted.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [#185](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/185) [`b7920e9`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/b7920e9a8cee1f15ee373651b40daae0c1977120) - Fix `intent list` suppressing the allow-all risk warning.

  When `intent.skills` is set to allow-all (`"*"`), `intent list --no-notices` and `INTENT_NO_NOTICES=1` no longer hide the warning that all skill sources are permitted. This banner is a security-relevant signal, not a migration tip, so it's now excluded from suppression while other notices remain suppressible as before.

- [#187](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/187) [`fb3c08b`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/fb3c08b9ff1332295e838a18b056673f59c99c2d) - Fix potential hangs on slow or large environments:

  - Bound the npm registry staleness check with a request timeout so `intent list` and other staleness checks can't hang indefinitely on a slow or unreachable registry.
  - Bound global package-manager detection with a command timeout so it can't hang indefinitely when the environment's global `node_modules` is slow to resolve.
  - Avoid enumerating a workspace package's entire skill tree just to check whether it has any skills, reducing filesystem work in large monorepos.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#180](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/180) [`d67a5d6`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/d67a5d6aad6635b3c903086ced56589dbf19168c) - Add proactive skill catalogs to installed Intent hooks.

  `intent hooks install` now installs session-start catalog hooks for supported agents alongside the existing edit gate. Agents see the allowed local Intent skills at session start, resume, clear, and compact where the agent supports those lifecycle events, then still need to run `intent load` before editing.

  The generated hook loads the catalog through the Intent CLI with agent audience redaction instead of importing package code from the target repository.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#176](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/176) [`5419b02`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/5419b0273ed3d1b09b488f10acf5f004dfec7e10) - Add agent-safe hidden skill source handling to `intent list`.

  `intent list` now detects agent sessions with `std-env` and redacts unlisted allowlist candidates from agent-facing output. Agents see allowed skills plus a count-only hidden-source notice, while `intent list --show-hidden` reveals hidden source names only outside agent sessions.

  Agent-mode JSON output includes `hiddenSourceCount` but leaves `hiddenSources` empty, preventing structured output from leaking package names that could be added to `package.json#intent.skills`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#174](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/174) [`089a355`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/089a3551467a428e2994633dc79ef47ef6b0d838) - Add `intent hooks install` for supported AI coding agents.

  This adds lifecycle-hook installation for supported agents, including project/user scope handling, generated hook runner scripts, and agent-specific enforcement policy. It also documents the hook setup flow and adds eval/test coverage for hooked intent discovery.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#171](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/171) [`392016b`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/392016b461578a76fdba6f25669154eb7a8bb150) - Adds package source-kind metadata to scanner results, tightens scan stats to match the runtime contract, and adds focused markdown destination rewrite coverage while preserving the current name-based allowlist behavior.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#169](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/169) [`0dbf9d0`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/0dbf9d05e3aa018461b6b1ffa00db350976f0835) - Add `intent validate --check` and `intent validate --fix` for mechanical `SKILL.md` frontmatter migrations.

  `--check` reports pending migrations without writing files. `--fix` rewrites fixable `name` and metadata scalar migrations, then re-runs validation.

### Patch Changes

- [#168](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/168) [`9eee8a5`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/9eee8a5f9f98c9d05d14cab3b8e07e68fe494f5c) - Make `SKILL.md` frontmatter spec-compliant. `name` must now be a spec-legal leaf segment matching its parent directory (lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens; 64 characters max; no slashes), and the Intent-specific scalars `type`, `library`, `library_version`, and `framework` live under the `metadata` map. `intent validate` now errors on a slash/non-leaf `name`, a `name` with non-spec characters or over 64 characters, non-spec top-level scalar keys, and a non-string `metadata` map. Skill identity is derived from the directory path rather than the frontmatter `name`, and the `generate-skill` and `tree-generator` templates emit the new shape.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#165](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/165) [`2676302`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/267630263126d318df06db6ec74345aef4fe5711) - Remove the unused feedback APIs, bundled feedback meta-skill, tests, and docs references.

- [#162](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/162) [`d5d9181`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/d5d91811ed273e5ede142213566f64d4533899ea) - Read skill frontmatter scalar fields (`type`, `framework`, `library_version`)
  from `metadata.*` with a fallback to the top-level key ([#159](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/issues/159)). This is a
  back-compat safety net for the frontmatter migration: skills authored in the
  new `metadata`-nested shape resolve correctly while existing top-level skills
  keep working unchanged. The scanner, staleness checker, and the framework
  `requires` validation all honor both shapes.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/157) [`665370e`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/665370eeda0187643141f7bfb40619a0c62383e9) - Add `package.json#intent.skills` source allowlisting to gate which discovered packages can contribute skills.

  `intent.exclude` now supports skill-level matching (for example `@scope/pkg#skill-id` and globs), and policy filtering is applied consistently across `intent list`, `intent load`, `intent install`, and `intent stale`. Notices are surfaced separately from warnings to keep command output machine-safe.

- [#157](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/157) [`665370e`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/665370eeda0187643141f7bfb40619a0c62383e9) - Add a persistent `intent exclude` command for managing `package.json#intent.exclude` (`list`, `add`, `remove`), and document it in the CLI/config guides.

  Add notice suppression controls for automation:
  - `--no-notices` on `intent list` and `intent install`
  - `INTENT_NO_NOTICES=1` environment variable

  Remove one-off CLI exclude flags from command surfaces (`list/load --exclude`); excludes are now managed via `package.json#intent.exclude` and `intent exclude`.

## 0.0.44

### Patch Changes

- [#154](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/154) [`d787ddc`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/d787ddc1e6151a4a663bc1604234cf57be597ddd) - Fix transitive skill discovery under pnpm's isolated linker. Skills shipped by a transitive dependency of a skill-bearing direct dependency were not discovered… Each package's dependencies are now resolved from its realpath, where pnpm resolution succeeds. Hoisted (npm/yarn/bun) layouts are unaffected.

## 0.0.43

### Patch Changes

- [#151](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/151) [`ae42b35`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/ae42b3503ea0d6b759795396b87e55d3d9bf72cc) - Fix skill discovery in Yarn Berry (PnP) projects. With `nodeLinker: pnp` and no
  `node_modules`, dependencies live in `.yarn/cache/*.zip` archives readable only
  through Yarn's libzip-patched filesystem. `intent list` and `intent load` now
  read package metadata and `SKILL.md` files from those archives — including when
  Intent runs via `npx`/`dlx` from outside the project's PnP graph. A failed PnP
  load fails closed with a clear diagnostic, and the PnP resolution hook is no
  longer left installed in Intent's process.

  Speed up skill discovery. Frontmatter parsing now reads only the leading region
  of each `SKILL.md` instead of the whole file (~4x faster on large skill bodies),
  and dependency resolution reuses its module resolver per package instead of
  rebuilding it for every dependency. Also drops redundant filesystem checks in the
  skill-file walk.

## 0.0.42

### Patch Changes

- [#148](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/148) [`a8e0ea1`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/a8e0ea161006d7f81af93c4494bd5a5a8c33ae0f) - Remove the abandoned `intent-library` bin and its `./intent-library` export. The legacy library-bin discovery model was replaced by the keyword-based model; anything invoking `intent-library` directly must move to the normal `intent` discovery flow (no compatibility shim).

## 0.0.41

### Patch Changes

- Fix package discovery for Yarn PnP projects and pnpm symlinked dependency trees, and use the detected package manager when printing Intent commands. ([#130](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/130))

## 0.0.40

### Patch Changes

- Reduce repeated filesystem work during Intent CLI scans by sharing package.json/skill discovery caches across scan paths and de-duping package-root and node_modules scan attempts within a single scan. Debug output now includes package.json read/cache-hit counts. ([#127](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/127))

## 0.0.39

### Patch Changes

- Replace custom version parsing and comparison with `semver` for stale drift reporting and installed package variant selection. ([#126](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/126))

  This improves handling for prereleases, build metadata, coerced versions, invalid versions, and downgrades while preserving the existing `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or `null` stale drift output.

## 0.0.38

### Patch Changes

- Refactor workspace pattern discovery to use a JSONC parser for Deno configs, support additional workspace config shapes, and cache workspace roots, parsed patterns, and resolved package directories during CLI commands. ([#125](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/125))

  This also allows Deno workspace members with `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` manifests to be resolved as workspace packages.

## 0.0.37

### Patch Changes

- Add the `@tanstack/intent/core` entrypoint for programmatic skill discovery and loading. ([#124](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/124))

  `intent load` now uses the core APIs and a direct dependency fast path, avoiding broad workspace scans when a requested skill can be resolved from the target package. This significantly improves load performance, especially in large workspaces, while preserving markdown link rewriting, warnings, debug output, and existing CLI behavior.

## 0.0.36

### Patch Changes

- Rewrite relative Markdown links in `intent load` output so referenced skill files resolve from the loaded skill location. This applies to normal output and JSON `content`, while `--path` remains unchanged. ([`c4bcade`](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/commit/c4bcade7b03009cc54974fa921a0895538d920cb))

## 0.0.35

### Patch Changes

- Fix `intent list` in projects with stale Yarn PnP files alongside project `node_modules`, including Bun isolated installs. Intent now prefers project `node_modules` when it exists and only loads Yarn's PnP API for PnP projects without `node_modules`. ([#122](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/122))

## 0.0.34

### Patch Changes

- Harden Intent skill checks for nested workspaces, generated GitHub workflows, Yarn PnP discovery, and Agent Skills spec compatibility. ([#121](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/121))

  `intent validate` now discovers package-local `skills/` directories from workspace configuration, including nested layouts. The generated `check-skills.yml` workflow now delegates PR validation and release/manual review PR generation to the CLI. `intent stale --github-review` writes review files with the reasons each skill or package was flagged.

  Intent package scanning also supports Yarn PnP projects through Yarn's PnP API, and validation now emits warning-only Agent Skills spec compatibility notices without failing existing Intent skills.

## 0.0.33

### Patch Changes

- Improve `intent stale` for monorepos by checking repo `_artifacts` coverage, flagging uncovered public workspace packages, and ignoring private workspaces. ([#120](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/120))

  The generated skills workflow now opens one grouped review PR with maintainer prompts, includes a workflow version stamp, and `intent stale` warns when maintainers should rerun `intent setup`.

## 0.0.32

### Patch Changes

- Add compact skill mappings and runtime resolution for agent config setup. ([#115](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/115))

  `intent install` now writes verified `intent-skills` blocks with compact `when`/`use` entries instead of embedding `load` paths. This keeps generated config portable across npm, pnpm, Bun, and Deno node_modules layouts, including transitive/package-manager-internal installs.

  Add `intent resolve <package>#<skill>` to resolve compact mappings to the installed skill path at runtime, with `--json`, `--global`, and `--global-only` support. `intent list`, `intent install`, and `intent resolve` now scan local project packages by default and require explicit global flags for global package scanning.

## 0.0.31

### Patch Changes

- Refactor package discovery into a dedicated registrar and dependency walker so project, workspace, and transitive dependencies are scanned consistently. Track local vs. global package sources and surface that in `intent list` via a `SOURCE` column. `intent stale` is now scoped to local and workspace packages; global packages are only included by `intent list` (which explicitly opts in). A new `scanForIntents` option `includeGlobal` controls global scanning for programmatic callers — this replaces the previous implicit behavior where setting `INTENT_GLOBAL_NODE_MODULES` caused all commands to scan globals. ([#112](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/112))

## 0.0.30

### Patch Changes

- Fix skill discovery so skills nested under intermediate grouping directories (directories without their own SKILL.md) are found by the scanner. ([#109](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/109))

## 0.0.28

### Patch Changes

- Read local package.json version before falling back to npm registry in `intent stale`. This fixes version drift detection for packages not published to public registry.npmjs.org (e.g. GitHub Packages, Artifactory, private registries). ([#104](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/104))

- - Added Deno monorepo setup coverage so setup-github-actions writes workflows at the workspace root and preserves monorepo-aware path substitutions. ([#106](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/106))

- Fix intent stale so monorepo package paths resolve to the targeted workspace package instead of scanning the whole workspace. ([#102](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/102))

## 0.0.26

### Patch Changes

- - Fix workspace package discovery for nested glob patterns, including support for `*` and `**`. Workspace patterns and resolved package roots are now normalized, deduped, and sorted, and the shared resolver has been extracted for reuse by internal workspace scanning. ([#93](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/93)) ([#100](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/100))
  - Refactor @tanstack/intent to use a shared project context resolver for workspace and package detection. This fixes monorepo targeting bugs in validate and edit-package-json, including pnpm workspaces defined only by pnpm-workspace.yaml. ([#93](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/93))
  - Use stable `node_modules/<name>/...` paths for skill references instead of absolute filesystem paths containing package-manager-internal directories with version numbers. Paths no longer break when packages are updated. ([#94](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/94))

## 0.0.25

### Patch Changes

- - Fix workspace package discovery for nested glob patterns, including support for `*` and `**`. Workspace patterns and resolved package roots are now normalized, deduped, and sorted, and the shared resolver has been extracted for reuse by internal workspace scanning. ([#93](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/93)) ([#99](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/99))
  - Refactor @tanstack/intent to use a shared project context resolver for workspace and package detection. This fixes monorepo targeting bugs in validate and edit-package-json, including pnpm workspaces defined only by pnpm-workspace.yaml. ([#93](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/93))
  - Use stable `node_modules/<name>/...` paths for skill references instead of absolute filesystem paths containing package-manager-internal directories with version numbers. Paths no longer break when packages are updated. ([#94](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/94))

## 0.0.22

### Patch Changes

- Refactored the CLI to use `cac`, replacing the previous hand-rolled parsing and dispatch logic with a more structured command system. ([#85](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/85))

  This update also fixes monorepo workflow generation behavior related to `setup-github-actions`, improving repo/package fallback handling and ensuring generated workflow watch paths are monorepo-aware.

## 0.0.21

### Patch Changes

- Replace hardcoded `TanStack/intent` dispatch target in `notify-intent.yml` template with `${{ github.repository }}` so the workflow works for any repo, not just TanStack org libraries. ([#82](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/82))

- Replace bin.intent detection with tanstack-intent keyword check for package discovery. Remove the `add-library-bin` command and bin shim generation system — packages are now identified by having `"tanstack-intent"` in their keywords array, which was already required for registry discovery. Also fix `collectPackagingWarnings` to skip the `!skills/_artifacts` warning for monorepo packages. ([#81](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/81))

- Make `scanForIntents` and `scanLibrary` synchronous instead of returning Promises for purely synchronous work. Clean up unnecessary async/await throughout source and tests, extract DRY test helpers, and improve type narrowing. ([#55](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/55))

- Add workspace-aware scanning so `intent list` discovers skills in monorepo workspace packages when run from the root. Replace `resolveDepDir` with `createRequire`-based resolution that handles hoisted deps, pnpm symlinks, and export maps. The `resolveDepDir` public API signature changed from 4 parameters to 2 — callers using the old signature should update to `resolveDepDir(depName, parentDir)`. `detectPackageManager` now checks workspace root for lockfiles when scanning from a subdir. ([#79](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/79))

- Improves the intent CLI with better setup validation, clearer feedback, version conflict detection, and improved monorepo support. ([#72](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/72))

## 0.0.18

### Patch Changes

- Add `tanstack-intent` keyword to package.json during setup ([#63](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/63))

- Make `edit-package-json` and `add-library-bin` monorepo-aware: when run from a monorepo root, they discover workspace packages containing SKILL.md files and apply changes to each package's package.json. Also improve domain-discovery skill to read in-repo docs before interviewing and avoid asking factual questions the agent can answer by searching the codebase. ([#67](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/67))

## 0.0.17

### Patch Changes

- rename notify-playbooks.yml to notify-intent.yml ([#60](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/60))

## 0.0.16

### Patch Changes

- enhance SKILL.md with detailed guidance on leveraging GitHub issues and discussions for skill improvement ([#56](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/56))

## 0.0.15

### Patch Changes

- enhance SKILL.md with detailed guidance on leveraging GitHub issues and discussions for skill improvement ([#56](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/56))

## 0.0.14

### Patch Changes

- Fix scanner to discover transitive dependencies with skills in non-hoisted layouts (pnpm). Add dependency tree walking via `resolveDepDir` that resolves packages through the pnpm virtual store. Also handle shim import errors gracefully when `@tanstack/intent` is not installed, and use `@latest` in all npx commands to avoid local binary conflicts. ([#46](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/46))

## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- Replace `intent setup` with three focused commands: `intent add-library-bin`, `intent edit-package-json`, and `intent setup-github-actions`. The new `edit-package-json` command automatically wires the `files` array and `bin` field, handling existing CLIs (both object and string shorthand forms) without clobbering them. Improve meta skill SKILL.md files based on real scaffolding feedback: soften lightweight path threshold, add companion library and experimental features questions, add YAML validation step, add subagent guidance for parallel generation, and replace inline feedback sections with a pointer to the feedback-collection skill. ([#37](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/37))

- 3 files changed in packages/playbooks/meta/ ([#33](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/33))

  domain-discovery/SKILL.md (681 → ~792 lines)
  - Added "Hard rules" section: 7 mandatory rules enforcing interactive interviews, prohibiting docs-as-substitute, question collapsing, and interview skipping
  - Added 3 STOP gates between phases (1→2, 3→4, and after Phase 2d skill list confirmation)
  - Strengthened Phase 2 & 4 headers with explicit interactivity requirements and "wait for response" instructions
  - Added Phase 3 thoroughness: file checklist before reading, read-all enforcement, peer dependency analysis in Phase 1b
  - Added 7 new constraint table rows for interview interactivity
  - Updated cross-model compatibility notes with STOP gate and question protection rationale
  - Added cross-package monorepo question in Phase 2a
  - Added packages field to domain_map.yaml schema (package-relative ownership model)
  - Softened feedback section to alpha-temporary
  - tree-generator/SKILL.md (859 → ~898 lines)
  - Strengthened compressed discovery warning (requires maintainer confirmation to skip)
  - Added packages field to skill_tree.yaml schema
  - Added monorepo placement section with concrete directory tree example showing skills inside each package
  - Added STOP gate after Step 1 (file tree review before writing)
  - Added STOP gate after Step 8 (validation results review)
  - Added 2 new constraint rows (file tree reviewed, validation presented)
  - Softened feedback section to alpha-temporary
  - generate-skill/SKILL.md (419 → ~441 lines)
  - Added packages field to frontmatter template
  - Added monorepo path guidance: skills ship inside each package, not repo root
  - Added STOP gate in Step 6: first skill reviewed before generating batch
  - Added first-skill-reviewed constraint row
  - Softened feedback section to alpha-temporary

## 0.1.0

### Patch Changes

- Add `intent-library` end-user CLI for library consumers. Libraries wire it up via a generated shim (`intent setup --shim`) to expose an `intent` bin. Running `intent list` recursively discovers skills across the library's dependency tree; `intent install` prints an agent-driven prompt to map skills to project tasks in CLAUDE.md. ([#9](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/pull/9))
